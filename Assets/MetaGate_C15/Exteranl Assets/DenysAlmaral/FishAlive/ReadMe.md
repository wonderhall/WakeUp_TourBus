## Introduction
Welcome to the Fish Alive Unity Package, a collection of low-poly animated reef fishes, designed to bring vibrant underwater life to your AR/VR, mobile, and desktop games. With natural swimming scripts and customizable behaviors, these fishes are ready to dive into your scenes.

## Getting Started
1. **Drag and Drop**: Simply drag the prefab of the fish you want to use into your scene.
2. **Assign a Target**: Select the fish in your scene and assign a target GameObject in the FishSwim component. The fish will naturally swim towards this target.

## Customizing Fish Behavior
FishSwim script use a scriptable object that defines various parameters for swimming behavior. Three presets are included:
- **SwimAgile**: For quick and nimble movements.
- **SwimClumsy**: For slower, more relaxed swimming.
- **SwimNormal**: A balanced swimming pattern.

You can assign these presets to any fish through the FishSwim component, or modify them to create your own unique swimming behaviors.

## Demo Scene
